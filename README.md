# uav_active_sensing

## Things to implement

* Implement a multi agent logic
* Implement elevation dynamics according to a validated physical model
* Fix image exploration environment for compatibility with any image

## Next steps

* Define a target task as a simulation environment. Programatically generate maps that can be explored
* Define baselines and run them to have reference scores to surpass
